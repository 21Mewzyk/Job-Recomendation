At present, many workers fail to take up valuablepension benefits because they do not make an application to join their employer's scheme. Auto-enrolment is meant to overcome this.From 1 October 2012 (subject to the employer's own introduction date), all eligible workers will have tobe auto-enrolled into a qualifying pension scheme. Employers can choose the qualifying scheme theyuse, which could include NEST (the National Employment Savings Trust). Each qualifying scheme mustmeet minimum standards in respect of the benefits it provides or the amount of contributions paid to it.The scheme must also provide auto-enrolment for all eligible workers and for all new workers when theybecome eligible.5 Tata consultancy servicesClient Name Legal and General (United Kingdom), IBMProject Title / Name Data Center Migration, Windows UpgradeProject Duration July 2011  June 2013.Project Location United Kingdom.Team Size 20Role Business CoordinatorTechnology Stack Quality center, Mainframes, HPS appbuilder, Java, SOAServices, Windows Xp, and UNIX.6 Tata consultancy servicesClient Name Legal and General (United Kingdom)Project Title / Name Work save Pension Trust(Company pension scheme) and worksave FundsProject Duration NOV 2010  Jun 20111Project Location Bangalore.Team Size 6Role Team LeadTechnology Stack Mainframes, HPS appbuilder, Java, SOA Services, Ecomm,web sphere applications Java, Windows Xp, UNIX.____________________________________________________________________________________________________7 Tata consultancy servicesClient Name Legal and General (United Kingdom)Project Title / Name Portfolio Regular Investment Plan(Qualifying savings Plan)Project Duration Apr 2010  October 2010.Project Location Bangalore.Team Size 5Role Business CoordinatorTechnology stack Mainframes, HPS appbuilder, Windows Xp, UNIX.Enhancement testing, Regression Testing,____________________________________________________________________________________________________8 Tata consultancy servicesClient Name Legal and General (United Kingdom).Project Title / Name Regular Contribution individual savings accountProject Duration Sep 2009 -July2010.Project Location Bangalore.Team Size 10Role Team leadTechnology stack Mainframes, HPS appbuilder, Java, SOA Services, Ecomm,web sphere applications Java, Windows Xp, UNIX.9 Tata consultancy servicesClient Name Legal and General (United Kingdom).Project Title / Name Pensions and Bonds (Personal, Stake holder pension)Project Duration July 2008 to Sep 2009.Project Location Bangalore.Team Size 6Role Team MemberTechnology stack Mainframes,HPS appbuilder, Ecomm,____________________________________________________________________________________________________10 Fidelity Investments PVT LTDClient Name ABB, Bank of America, Agilent, Fidelity, Knight Rider, FirstAmerican Corporation, Analog Devices, Visitor, BASF.Project Title / Name Oracle Human Resource Management Systems.(HR Payroll)Project Duration Feb 2006 to May 2008.Project Location Bangalore.Team Size 10Role Team MemberTechnology stack Java, Oracle apps, Oracle 9I, SQL, Windows Xp, and UNIX.QTPProject DescriptionOracle HRMS payroll is a management system which can help you to control workforce Costs andensure that the entire workforce is being paid on time and according to companys customizedcompensation rules and fully integrated with Oracle Financials.
